I Ching Oracular Divination Meets Twitter

Ought to work simply by cloning (or downloading) onto your computer and running in [Processing 3.0](https://processing.org/) for OSX.

And by 'ought', I mean that first you need to [create an application](http://apps.twitter.com/) and obtain a set of API keys from Twitter.  Then, place your API keys [here](https://github.com/skilfullycurled/tweetching/blob/master/Oracle.pde#L30).

If you encounter any trouble, please feel free to leave an issue.  Having an issue to deal with will really make me feel like I'm wearing my big person's engineers cap!
